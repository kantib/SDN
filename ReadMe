Following steps shows how to run:
1. SimpleThreadFirewall.py
2. SimpleRestFirewall.py

RYU SDN controller applications.

Initial setup:
1. Install RYU SDN controller on Ubuntu Linux (https://osrg.github.io/ryu/)
2. Install mininet (http://mininet.org/download/)
3. Save SimpleThreadFirewall.py and SimpleRestFirewall.py in ~/ryu/ryu/app
4. Save blacklist.txt file in ~/ryu/ryu/app

RUNNING SimpleThreadFirewall
#############################

1. Start a terminal and run SimpleThreadFirewall application 
> ryu-manager SimpleThreadFirewall.py

2. Start a terminal and create a virtual network topology with one switch, 
   three hosts connected to the switch.
> sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --controller remote --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13

3. Your switch is active with initial firewall rules configured from
   blacklist.txt file. Now edit blacklist.txt file to change the access
   configuration and save the changes. Now observe RYU controller logs
   for your changed configuration to become effective on the switch.
   ex: Initial configuration from blacklist.txt is blocking ICMP packets
   between Host1 and Host2. 

   [10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, icmp, DENY]

   Test and verify ping command fails initially between Host1 and Host2.
   Change blacklist.txt configuration to allow ICMP packets between Host1 and
   Host2.

   [10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, icmp, ALLOW]

   save this change. Now after few seconds verify you can ping from Host1 to
   Host2 and vice versa.

   Test and verify ping command fails initially between Host1 and Host2.

4. Start a terminal and issue following "CURL" command to list current
   access rules/ flow rules on the switch.

> curl  http://localhost:8080/simpleswitch/flowrules/0000000000000001

   Observe controller logs for response status (200-OK, 404-error, 500-error)
  
5. Issue following curl command to add a single flow rule to the specified
   switch.

> curl http://localhost:8080/simpleswitch/flowrules/0000000000000001 -X PUT -d ' {"src_ip":"10.0.0.1","dst_ip":"10.0.0.2","action":"DENY","protocol":"icmp"}'

   Observe controller logs for response status of 200 for this request execution
   You can confirm that the flow rule is added on the switch by issueing 
   following command on the mininet cosole.

> sh sudo ovs-ofctl dump-flows s1 -O OpenFlow13

6. Issue following curl command to delete entire flow rules from the table
   for a specified switch.

> curl http://localhost:8080/simpleswitch/flowrules/0000000000000001 -X DELETE

   Confirm the same from controller logs and mininet console.
